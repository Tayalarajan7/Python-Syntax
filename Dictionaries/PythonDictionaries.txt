Dictionary:
	Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

	A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not
allow duplicates.

	Note: As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6
and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

	Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.

	Dictionary items are ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicate
values.

Changeable:
	Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove
items after the dictionary has been created.

Duplicates not allowed:
	Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.

Note: Duplicate value will override existing values.

Get Items:
The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.

Update Dictionary:
The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given 
argument.

The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
