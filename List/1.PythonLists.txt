List:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in python used to store collections of
data.

* List
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Tuple
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Set
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
* Dictionary
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.

List are created using square brackets

Create a List:
thisList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thisList)

Output:
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

List Items are
* Ordered
* Changeable
* Allow duplicate values

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index[1]
etc.

List Methods:
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()		Removes all the elements from the list
copy()		Returns a copy of the list

insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()		Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()		Sorts the list

List Length:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
