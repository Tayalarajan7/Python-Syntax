Python Operators:
Python divides the operators in the following groups:
* Arithmetic operators
+	Addition	x + y	
-	Subtraction	x - y	
*	Multiplication	x * y	
/	Division	x / y	
%	Modulus		x % y	
**	Exponentiation	x ** y	
//	Floor division	x // y

* Assignment operators
=	x = 5		x = 5	
+=	x += 3		x = x + 3	
-=	x -= 3		x = x - 3	
*=	x *= 3		x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3		x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3		x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3		x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3		x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3		x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3		x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3		x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3		x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3		x = x << 3

* Comparison operators
==	Equal				x == y	
!=	Not equal			x != y	
>	Greater than			x > y	
<	Less than			x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to		x <= y

* Logical operators
and 	Returns True if both 	x < 5 and  x < 10
	statements are true
	
or	Returns True if one 	x < 5 or x < 4
	of the statements is 
	true
	
not	Reverse the result,  	not(x < 5 and x < 10)
	returns False if the
	result is true

* Identity operators
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

* Membership operators
in 	Returns True if a sequence  	x in y	
	with the specified value is
	present in the object

not in	Returns True if a sequence  	x not in y
	with the specified value is
	not present in the object

* Bitwise operators
& 	AND			Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR			Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR			Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	NOT			Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and 
				let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit 
				in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall 
				off
